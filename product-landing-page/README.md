# [Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/)

A Product Landing Page as a freeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Track Project, where I created a fictional product landing page to show what the product can offer in a web page.

## Built with:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- [CodePen](https://codepen.io/genesisgabiola/full/zMYPgX/)

## Future Improvements:
- [ ] Organize Images and make it more responsive.
- [ ] Add some styling and animation.
- [ ] Add a background picture in the video and fix the overlay background image.
