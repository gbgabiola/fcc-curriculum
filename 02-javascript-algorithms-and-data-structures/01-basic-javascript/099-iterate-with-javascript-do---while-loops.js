/** Challenge: Iterate with JavaScript Do...While Loops
 *
 * Change the while loop in the code to a do...while loop so the loop will push only the number 10 to myArray, and i will be equal to 11 when your code has finished running.
 */

// Setup
var myArray = [];
var i = 10;

do {
  myArray.push(i);
  i++;
} while (i < 5);

// myArray: 10
