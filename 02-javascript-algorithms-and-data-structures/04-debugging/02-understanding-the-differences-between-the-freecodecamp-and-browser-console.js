/**
 * Challenge: First, use console.clear() to clear the browser console. After that, use console.log to log the output variable.
 */

// Open your browser console.
let output = 'Get this to log once in the browser console and twice in the freeCodeCamp console';
console.clear();
console.log(output); // Get this to log once in the browser console and twice in the freeCodeCamp console

// Check the two consoles to see the difference. The freeCodeCamp console should have printed the variable twice, once for each test of this challenge. The browser console should only print the variable once because you cleared it first.
